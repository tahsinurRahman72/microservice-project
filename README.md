# VizWorks

VizWorks is a robust and scalable web application designed to simplify data visualization through a microservices architecture. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data analyst, our platform makes it easy to transform raw data into clear, impactful visual representations.

## Built with Modern Technologies

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component of VizWorks—the frontend, backend, Nginx, and PostgreSQL database—operates as a separate microservice. Managed with Docker Compose, this architecture ensures our application is both robust and scalable.
- **Next.js and TailwindCSS**: Our frontend is built using the powerful Next.js framework, enhanced with TailwindCSS for responsive design and Shadcn for efficient component styling, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Express.js Backend**: The backend is powered by Express.js, offering a lightweight, yet powerful framework for handling our application’s server-side logic.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: We use PostgreSQL for its advanced features in handling structured data and complex queries, ensuring data integrity and flexibility in data management.

## Key Features

- **Data Upload**: Securely upload your data directly to our PostgreSQL database through our intuitive web interface.
- **Interactive Data Table**: View your uploaded data in an organized, interactive table format, allowing for easy data management and exploration.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: Select specific data rows and columns to create dynamic graphs and charts, tailored to emphasize the insights that matter most to you.
